/* here the parent element is the div of font size 32. the size of relative text is 4em, hence, it equals to 32 and the size of the absolute element text is 32px, it remains the same and both the text looks equal, if we change the font size of the parent element the size of the element which uses the relative sizing will also change. */

/* if there is no parent div for the relative sizing, then the size of relative sizing will be taken from the browser value */
